# AI Lab Recipes

This repo contains recipes for building and running containerized AI and LLM Applications locally with [podman](https://podman.io/).

These containerized AI recipes can be used to help developers quickly prototype new AI and LLM based applications without the need to rely on any other externally hosted services. Since they are already containerized, it also helps developers move quickly from prototype to production.

### Model Services

Model services can be used for various applications with various models to host endpoints developers can easily integrate into their applications.
